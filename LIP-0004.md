## Simple Summary

LRC-10 are a valued part of Token Creation

## Abstract

- The LRC-10 issuance fee is too low to prevent spam and misrepresentation.
- Raising the issuance fee from 1,024 XLT to 1,000,000 XLT is a logical solution.
- Increasing to this level helps limit unwarranted LRC10 Token Creation.
